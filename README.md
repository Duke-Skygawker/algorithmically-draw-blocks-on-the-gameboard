# Algorytmically draw blocks on the gameboard using Javascript and HTML

determined by blockQuantity array, 1= draws block, anything else, doesn't (in this case I used 0 to signal no block)

nested array improves quality of life for level building

added block class for better readability and future collision detection

all dimensions can be changed in the index.js
